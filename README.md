## VBCorLib v1\.0


</div>

### Description

Version 1.0 finally! This massive library has finally reached what I consider a production version. With newly added classes for math, resource, Base64, and guid handling, this library brings an amazing amount of functionality. Once again, there are way too many classes and functions to mention here. As many of you know, I have been implementing many of the classes found in the .NET framework into this library and here is the result. Please visit www.kellyethridge.com/vbcorlib for tutorials and documentation.
